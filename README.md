# Web-Scraping - Mars News

## Project Description: 

Using knowledge of HTML elements, Chrome DevTools, and Beautiful Soup to scrape titles and previews from news articles on a Mars news website.

We then scraped a Mars weather/temperature site, and extracted values from the sites table and performed data analysis using Pandas on the weather data.

### Part 1 - Scraping the [Mars news website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) 🪐📰:

Jupyter Notebook code file: [part_1_mars_news.ipynb](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/part_1_mars_news.ipynb)

Section 1 requires Splinter, BeautifulSoup, JSON, and Chrome DevTools.

The final output for Part 1 includes the Mars news article titles and previews stored in the [news_data.json](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/news_data.json) file.

### Part 2 - Scraping the [Mars weather data website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) 🪐☀️🌦️:

Jupyter Notebook code file: [part_2_mars_weather.ipynb](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)

Section 2 requires Splinter, Beautiful Soup, Matplotlib, and Pandas. 

The final scraped weather data is stored in the CSV file [mars_analysis.csv](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/mars_analysis.csv)
